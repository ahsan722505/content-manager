I call it as content manager. Some people may call it as clipboard manager but it does more than a clipboard manager.

Features:

=> It is a Cross Platform application (windows, linux, mac).

=> It can store clipboard history.

=> You can paste contents using hotkeys(shortcuts). Some default hotkeys are ctrl +1 (to paste latest copied content), ctrl + 2 (to paste second latest copied content),......... until ctrl + 9

=> You can also assign hotkey to individual content.

=> You can synchronize clipboards between different devices (Copy on one device and paste in another.)  -----> coming soon

=> This app can be your password manager as well.
